# NetDaemon V4 - alpha version

This is the alpha version of the upcoming version 4 of NetDaemon. The main change is full support for .NET 8. We will continue to support the V3.1 until .NET 7 runs out of support. Once we release this .NET 8 based version 4 of the runtime, no further development will be done on v3.

Stay tuned for instructions how to upgrade to this version within a few weeks.
